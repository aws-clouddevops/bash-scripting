# bash-scripting

This is the repository to learn bash scripting.

### Also I'll give names as 01 , 02 , 03 , 04 to indicate the sequence to learn

#### Few of the git commands that we would use during our upcoming journey

1) Git clone repository     : Download the whole repository
2) git pull                 : Download only changes
3) git add fileName         : Git will start tracking that you're making   on the file named fileName
4) git commit -m "msg Name" : Adding msg to the commit / changes that ayou made.
5) git push                 : Your changes will be pushed to the repo

### PS: Ensure you are inside the repo to execute the git commands ; we will preform clone once and pull multiple times
